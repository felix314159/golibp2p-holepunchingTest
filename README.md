# golibp2p-holepunchingTest
Testing go-libp2p holepunching with minimal example and some more info for veryifing that holepunching can work.

## Problem
A node run by this is able to be holepunched by other nodes. However, you can not run a node with this code to holepunch someone else (so the logic for initiating the holepunch in this code seems to be wrong, but a node run by this code is able to get holepunched by other tools). So what am I doing wrong?
